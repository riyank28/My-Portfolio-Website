<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! I'm Riyank Jain, currently pursuing Btech at Thapar University. As an enthusiastic learner in the field of Electronics and instrumentation and control (EIC), I'm also passionate about CSE related subjects.</p>

<p>My journey at Thapar has been an exciting exploration of my mind. I'm dedicated to honouring my skills in DSA, and I'm eager to contribute these talents to real-world challenges.</p>

<p>When I'm not immersed in my studies, you might find me swimming or playing table tennis. I believe in the power of collaboration and I'm always seeking opportunities to connect with fellow students, professionals, and experts in my branch or in other. Let's exchange ideas, share experience, and inspire each other's growth.</p>
